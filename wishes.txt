I need a personalized chatbot incorporating RAG such that:

- has a vector database, containing my personal info in a variety of information, such as text, images, and audio

- the vector database should also be able to store data spanning a long period of time

- the vector database should be able to update and store data from multiple sources. However, for now,
  let's just fetch data from a specific local directory, and then, through a local llm, embbed the fetched data
  in the vector database

- when ever I ask a question, it will first search the vector database for relevant information
  - If the relevant information is enough to answer the question, then:
    - the program should answer the question directly

  - If the relevant information is not enough to answer the question, then:
    - the program should fetch information of me relevant to the question from the database first,
      and send them to the an online llm, along with my original prompt, so that the online llm
      can generate a full answer based on the relevant information

- it should be able to answer questions about my personal information
